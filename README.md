# Accident_Detection_Project
## Abstract:
 The frequency of traffic accidents is rising, which emphasizes the significance of quick and efficient accident detection systems to enhance traffic safety and emergency response. To save lives and reduce damage after an accident on one of our roads, quick action is necessary. Traditional accident detection techniques sometimes fail to send out signals in a timely manner. Imagine a future where security cameras do more than just monitor our surroundings; they also actively seek to keep us safe. By seamlessly integrating with security cameras, recording video streams, and extracting frames for in-the-moment accident categorization using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture, this model realizes this objective. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), a subclass of deep neural networks popularised for their efficiency in image processing applications, are utilized by the proposed model. The main goal of this project is to create a CNN-based model capable of real-time video stream analysis and accident visual cue identification. This model collects frames from security camera footage and processes them using CNNarchitecture to perform accident categorization. It estimates the likelihood of an accident and makes an accident prediction. The system emits a buzzer sound when the likelihood is more than 90%.
